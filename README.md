## CO_SpecialDistrict
*Project to Map all Special Districts in Colorado*

**Background**: DOLA used to maintain Special District boundaries.  However, back around 2004, things were becoming overwhelming.  The number of districts in Colorado had grown past 1,000, exceeding the capacity of the GIS staff to maintain (who numbered only 1).

Fast forward to 2015.  The number of Special Districts in the State is now over 3,000!  The GIS staff at DOLA is still only 1.  However, between technology upgrades and a vast improvement in State GIS coordination efforts, it is once again realistic to maintain Special District GIS information.

#### About
This webmap is a tool to view and download GIS data for Special Districts.<br />
- Search for Districts, either by name, lgid number, or by type.
- Get up to date information on contact informatin, mill levy's, and even a direct link to that specific district's DOLA's information page.
- Download the data in GIS Shapefile format.

The data in this map is updated as we receive information.  See metadata information <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gaOjeXlLzQankggbhtrQq3HDEPfwwiXiPeSZrP6FjOs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.  We do not have 100% coverage of districts.  Many rural areas of the Colorado do not yet have GIS capability.  I am more than happy to digitize based off of paper maps, but sometimes even that information is not readily available.  If you have data to contribute, please email: **robert.kemp@state.co.us **
